In this exercise, you will learn how to deploy a mysql database using ConfigMaps and Secrets features.

#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Deploy mysql database
- Use ConfigMaps for env variables
- Use secretes to protect sensitive data

#Prerequisites
Make sure that your cluster is up and running.


#Steps

1. Create a new project:
   
   Open a terminal on workstation (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run the following commands:    

   ```
   mkdir ~/config-lab
   cd ~/config-lab
   ```

2. Create a namespace for our lab

   Namespaces are used to organize our work and keep track of every kubernetes object we create.
   That's why we will create a namespace for this lab
   ```
   kubectl create ns config-lab
   ```

3. Create a ConfigMap 

  As you probably know, mysql requires some environement variables in order to run such as MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD. 
  We will start with creating a ConfigMap containing the needed env variables for mysql.
  - <span class="important-header">Imperative approach: </span>

  Run the following command to create a new configmap named mysql-configmap-demo (We will not be using this configmap in this lab, it's only for the demo purpose)
  ```
  kubectl create configmap mysql-configmap-demo --from-literal=MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=user123 --from-literal=MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb -n config-lab       
  ```        
  In order to check our created configmap, run
  ```
  kubectl get configmaps -n config-lab
  ```
  Run the describe command:
  ```    
  kubectl describe configmaps mysql-configmap-demo -n config-lab
  ```
  ```
  Name:         mysql-configmap-demo
  Namespace:    config-lab
  Labels:       <none>
  Annotations:  <none>
  
  Data
  ====
  MYSQL_DATABASE:
  ----
  mydb
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:
  ----
  user123
  Events:  <none>
  ```   
  Remove it:
  ```
  kubectl delete configmaps mysql-configmap-demo -n config-lab
  ```
  ```
  configmap "mysql-configmap-demo" deleted
  ```    
  - <span class="important-header">Declarative approach: </span>

  Create a file named mysql-configmap.yaml with the content below: 
    ```
    vim mysql-configmap.yaml
    ```
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: mysql-configmap
      namespace: config-lab
    data: 
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: user123
    ```
  Now, we just need to create the configamp using
    ```
    kubectl apply -f mysql-configmap.yaml
    ```
    In order to check our created configmap, run
    ```
    kubectl get configmaps -n config-lab
    ```


4. Deploy a mysql server

  In this section, we'll create the mysql server and we will use the previous configmap in order to set up the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD.
  Create a file named mysql.yaml with the content below: 
  ``` 
  vim mysql.yaml
  ``` 
  ``` 
  apiVersion: apps/v1 
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mysql
    namespace: config-lab
  spec: 
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: mysql
    strategy:
      type: Recreate
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: mysql
      spec:
        containers:
        - image: mysql
          name: mysql
          envFrom:
          - configMapRef: 
              name: mysql-configmap
          ports:
          - containerPort: 3306
            name: mysql  
  ```
  Create the new depolyment:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f mysql.yaml
  ```
  Check the deployment STATUS
  ```
  kubectl get deployments -n config-lab # Add -w to kubectl command to follow the resource status in real time 
  ```
  In order to check our created pods, run
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n config-lab 
  ```
  Output will be something like this, copy the name of the pod.
  ```
  NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  mysql-75b956cdfb-ns82h   1/1     Running   0          50s
  ```
5. Access the mysql server

  At this point, we have a running instance of mysql in our K8S cluster. 
  We'll try accessing the mysql server via:
  
  ```
  kubectl exec -it mysql-75b956cdfb-ns82h -n config-lab -- mysql -u root -p 
  ```
  Now, you should enter the password that we chose in our configmap at first: (user123)
  ```
  Enter password: 
  ```
  You should be able to see this as output:
  ```
  Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
  .
  .
  Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
  affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
  owners.
  
  mysql>
  ```
  ```
  use mysql; show tables;
  ```
  Output: 
  ```
  Database changed
  +---------------------------+
  | Tables_in_mysql           |
  +---------------------------+
  | columns_priv              |
  | component                 |
  .                           .
  .                           .
  | time_zone_transition_type |
  | user                      |
  +---------------------------+
  33 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
  ```
  exit
  ```
6. The secret behind SECRETS

  In the previous example, the sensitive env variable MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is in plain text available in our cluser. 
  
  Which is considered as a wrong practice, since anyone accessing the cluster, could get the password. 

  That's where secrets comes in, they're almost like the configmaps, but they store sensitive data encrypted instead of plain text.
  
  In our case, we will take out the password variable from the config map and store it into a secret instead.
      
  - <span class="important-header">Imperative approach </span>

  Run the following command to create a new secret named mysql-secret-demo (We will not be using this configmap in this lab, it's only for the demo purpose)
  ```
  kubectl create secret generic mysql-secret-demo --from-literal=MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=user123 -n config-lab 
  ```        
  In order to check our created secrets, run
  ```
  kubectl get secrets -n config-lab
  ```
  Run the describe command:
  ```
  kubectl describe secret mysql-secret-demo -n config-lab
  ```
  ```

  Name:         mysql-secret-demo
  Namespace:    config-lab
  Labels:       <none>
  Annotations:  <none>

  Type:  Opaque

  Data
  ====
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:  7 bytes
  ```
  Remove it:
  ```  
  kubectl delete secret mysql-secret-demo -n config-lab
  ```
  - <span class="important-header">Declarative approach: </span>

  In order to get the encoded value of a certain password, you can use this command:
  ```
  echo -n "user123" | base64
  ```
  Then, after getting the encoded value, you can insert it in the file mysql-secret.yaml

  Create a file named mysql-secret.yaml with the content below: 
  ```
  vim mysql-secret.yaml
  ```
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: mysql-secret
    namespace: config-lab
  data: 
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: (encoded value of your password)
  ```
  And run this command:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f mysql-secret.yaml
  ```
  In order to check our created secrets, run
  ```
  kubectl get secrets -n config-lab
  ```

7. Integrate secrets into mysql 

  In this section, we'll integrate what we've learned in this lab all together:
  
  Start with creating a configmap, without any sensitive data, in a file called mysql-secured-configmap.yaml:
  
  ```
  vim mysql-secured-configmap.yaml
  ```  
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: mysql-secured-configmap
    namespace: config-lab
  data: 
    MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
  ```
  Now, we just need to create the configamp using
  ```
  kubectl create -f mysql-secured-configmap.yaml
  ```
  In order to check our created configmap, run
  ```
  kubectl get configmaps -n config-lab
  ```
  Finally, we'll create the mysql deployment, in a file named mysql-secured-deployment.yaml:
  
  ```
  vim mysql-secured-deployment.yaml
  ```
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mysql-secured-deployment
    namespace: config-lab
  spec: 
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: mysql
    strategy:
      type: Recreate
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: mysql
      spec:
        containers:
        - image: mysql
          name: mysql
          envFrom:
          - configMapRef: 
              name: mysql-secured-configmap
          - secretRef:
              name: mysql-secret
          ports:
          - containerPort: 3306
            name: mysql
  ```
  Now, we just need to create the configamp using
  ```
  kubectl apply -f mysql-secured-deployment.yaml
  ```
  Check the deployment STATUS
  ```
  kubectl  get deployments -n config-lab # Add -w to kubectl command to follow the resource status in real time 
  ```
  In order to check our created pods, run
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n config-lab
  ```
  Output will be something like this, copy the name of the pod.
  ```
  NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  mysql-75b956cdfb-bt49e   1/1     Running   0          50s
  ```
  
8. Access the new mysql server

  At this point, we have a running instance of mysql in our k8s cluster. 
  We'll try accessing the mysql server via:
  
  ```
  kubectl exec -it mysql-75b956cdfb-bt49e -n config-lab -- mysql -u root -p 
  ```
  Now, you should enter the password that we chose in our configmap at first: (user123)
  ```
  Enter password: 
  ```
  You should be able to see this as output:
  ```
  Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
  .
  .
  Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
  affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
  owners.
  
  mysql>
  ```
  As you can conclude, secrets did work fine, now let's test the config map by using the mydb database:
  ```
  mysql> use mydb;
  ```
  You should be able to see:
  ```
  Database changed
  ```
  ```
  exit
  ```

9. Clean up

  In order to keep our cluster clean and do not waste ressources, we'll delete the entire namespace that we created earlier.
  We can do this by using this command.

   ```
   kubectl delete ns config-lab
   ```
   Then we will delete the working space:
   ```
   sudo rm -rf ~/config-lab
   ```
