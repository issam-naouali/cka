In this exercice, we will work with rolling updates and rollbacks.

#Outcomes

You should be able to do:
 - RollingUpdates
 - Rollbacks
 - Clean up


#Steps

One of the advantages of micro-services is the ability to replace and upgrade a container while continuing to respond to client
requests. 

We will use the OnDelete setting that upgrades a container when the predecessor is deleted, then the use the
RollingUpdate feature as well, which begins a rolling update immediately.

1. Create a workspace for Kubernetes
   
   Open a terminal on workstation (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run the following commands:    
   
   Switch to root user:
   ```
   vagrant ssh master // if you are not connected to the master node
   sudo -i
   ```
   ```
   mkdir ~/updates-lab
   cd ~/updates-lab
   ```

2. Create a namespace for our lab

   Namespaces are used to organize our work and keep track of every kubernetes object we create.
   That's why we will create a namespace for this lab
   ```
   kubectl create namespace updates-lab
   ```
   Now to check that we successfully created it, run this command
   ```
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```
   Output should be like this:
   ```
   NAME              STATUS   AGE
   default           Active   3d9h
   kube-node-lease   Active   3d9h
   kube-public       Active   3d9h
   kube-system       Active   3d9h
   updates-lab       Active   6s
   ```
3. Create a deployment

  Create an empty file:
  ```
  vi deploy.yaml
  ```
  Press "i" to enter vi insert mode, then paste this:
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: my-deployment
    namespace: updates-lab 
  spec:
    replicas: 4
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: frontend-app
    strategy:
      rollingUpdate:
        maxSurge: 25%
        maxUnavailable: 25%
      type: RollingUpdate
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: frontend-app
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: frontend-container
          image: kodekloud/webapp-color:v1
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8080
  ```
  Now, we just need to create it using
  ```
  kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
  ```
  Then create this NodePort service:
  ```
  vi service.yaml
  ```
  ```
  apiVersion: v1 
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myfrontend-service
    namespace: updates-lab 
  spec: 
    type: NodePort
    ports:
      - targetPort: 8080
        port: 80
        nodePort: 30030
    selector:
        app: frontend-app
  ```
  Then,
  ```
  kubectl apply -f service.yaml
  ```
  ```
  service/myfrontend-service created
  ```
  Now, in order to check that our configuration is valid, you can run:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -o wide -n updates-lab 
  ```
  Output
  ```
  NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP          NODE            NOMINATED NODE   
  my-deployment-df57bfb88-5ngj2   1/1     Running   0          7m49s   10.32.0.4   worker-node1    <none>           
  my-deployment-df57bfb88-694rs   1/1     Running   0          7m49s   10.44.0.6   worker-node-2   <none>           
  my-deployment-df57bfb88-j7pdw   1/1     Running   0          7m49s   10.32.0.6   worker-node1    <none>           
  my-deployment-df57bfb88-n5qzz   1/1     Running   0          7m49s   10.44.0.5   worker-node-2   <none>           
  ```
  As you can see, our pods are up and running, so get the ip address of any worker nodes, since our deployment is available on both nodes:
  
  ```
  ip a | grep eth1 | grep inet
  ```
  Then all you need to do, is to change the one below "192.168.1.20" with the ip address that you just found:
  ```
  http://192.168.1.20:30030
  ```

4. Check rolling updates

  Let's check the strategy used in this deployment:
  ```
  kubectl describe deployment my-deployment -n updates-lab
  ```
  ```
  Name:                   my-deployment
  Namespace:              updates-lab
  CreationTimestamp:      Sun, 18 Oct 2020 00:44:34 -0400
  Labels:                 <none>
  Annotations:            deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 1
  Selector:               app=frontend-app
  Replicas:               4 desired | 4 updated | 4 total | 4 available | 0 unavailable
  StrategyType:           RollingUpdate
  MinReadySeconds:        0
  RollingUpdateStrategy:  25% max unavailable, 25% max surge
  Pod Template:
    Labels:  app=frontend-app
    Containers:
     frontend-container:
      Image:        kodekloud/webapp-color:v1
      Port:         8080/TCP
      Host Port:    0/TCP
      Environment:  <none>
      Mounts:       <none>
    Volumes:        <none>
  Conditions:
    Type           Status  Reason
    ----           ------  ------
    Available      True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
    Progressing    True    NewReplicaSetAvailable
  OldReplicaSets:  <none>
  NewReplicaSet:   my-deployment-df57bfb88 (4/4 replicas created)
  Events:
    Type    Reason             Age   From                   Message
    ----    ------             ----  ----                   -------
    Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  26s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set my-deployment-df57bfb88 to 4
  ```
  As you can see, it says RollingUpdate under the Strategy section. Which means if we update this deployment, pods are going to be take down few at a time and replaced with the new pods.
  Let's edit the yaml file and check ourselves.
  ```
  kubectl edit deployment my-deployment -n updates-lab 
  ```
  Go to the section spec> template > spec > containers > image:

  Then update it with this new image:
  ```
  - image: kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
  ```
  Save and quit vi by pressing "ESC" then "ZZ".
  Now, let's check how our deployment is updated:
  ```
  kubectl describe deployment my-deployment -n updates-lab
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Name:                   my-deployment
  Namespace:              updates-lab
  CreationTimestamp:      Sun, 18 Oct 2020 00:44:34 -0400
  Labels:                 <none>
  Annotations:            deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 2
  Selector:               app=frontend-app
  Replicas:               4 desired | 3 updated | 5 total | 3 available | 2 unavailable
  StrategyType:           RollingUpdate
  MinReadySeconds:        0
  RollingUpdateStrategy:  25% max unavailable, 25% max surge
  Pod Template:
    Labels:  app=frontend-app
    Containers:
     frontend-container:
      Image:        kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
      Port:         8080/TCP
      Host Port:    0/TCP
      Environment:  <none>
      Mounts:       <none>
    Volumes:        <none>
  Conditions:
    Type           Status  Reason
    ----           ------  ------
    Available      True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
    Progressing    True    ReplicaSetUpdated
  OldReplicaSets:  my-deployment-df57bfb88 (2/2 replicas created)
  NewReplicaSet:   my-deployment-59554947c (3/3 replicas created)
  Events:
    Type    Reason             Age    From                   Message
    ----    ------             ----   ----                   -------
    Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m33s  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set my-deployment-df57bfb88 to 4
    Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  7s     deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set my-deployment-59554947c to 1
    Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  7s     deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set my-deployment-df57bfb88 to 3
    Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  7s     deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set my-deployment-59554947c to 2
    Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  2s     deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set my-deployment-df57bfb88 to 2
    Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  2s     deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set my-deployment-59554947c to 3
  ```
  As you can see in the events section, there is one v2 scaled up, then one v1 pod scaled down, etc...

  Let's check our browser again, be refreshing the same old page
  ```
  http://192.168.1.20:30030
  ```
  Copy that link into your browser:

5. Rollout history

  In order to check the history of all the rollouts in a specific deployment you can run this command:
  ```
  kubectl rollout history deployment my-deployment -n updates-lab
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
  1         <none>
  2         <none>
  ```
6. Rollback to an earlier Deployment
  
  We can do a Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable due to the application code or the configuration. 
  
  First, let's check the replicasets in our namespace:

  ```
  kubectl get replicasets -n updates-lab
  ```
  Output
  ```
  NAME                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
  my-deployment-59554947c   4         4         4       4m15s
  my-deployment-df57bfb88   0         0         0       8m54s
  ```
  As you can see, we have two replicasets for my-deployment, one having 0 running pods and the newer one have 4 runnings pods. 
  
  The newer one represents the new version that we rolled out to. Now let's perform a role back and check again:
  ```
  kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deployment -n updates-lab
  ```
  - Add --to-revision=number to rollback to a specific revision
  
  ```
  kubectl get replicasets -n updates-lab
  ```
  Output
  ```
  NAME                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
  my-deployment-59554947c   0         0         0       4m37s
  my-deployment-df57bfb88   4         4         4       9m16s
  ```
  As you can see, the newer replicaset is now down and the previous state is back and running.

7. Clean up

  In order to keep our cluster clean and do not waste ressources, we'll delete the entire namespace that we created earlier.
  We can do this by using this command.

   ```
   kubectl delete namespace updates-lab
   ```
   Then we will delete the working space:
   ```
   sudo rm -rf ~/updates-lab
   ```
