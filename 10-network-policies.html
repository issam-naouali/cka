In this exercice, we will discuss NetworkPolicies and demonstrate how to create a simple policy to restrict access to a pod.

#Outcomes

You should be able to:
 - Create NetworkPolicies
 - Get information about NetworkPolicies

 <b>Estimated time: 20 mins </b>
#Steps

From a security perspective, it is often a good idea to place network-level restrictions on any communication between different parts of your infrastructure. 

NetworkPolicies allow you to restrict and control the network traffic going to and from your pods. 


1. Create a workspace for Kubernetes
   
   Open a terminal on workstation (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run the following commands:    
   ```
   vagrant ssh master // if you are not connected to the master node
   sudo -i
   ```
   ```
   mkdir ~/network-policy-lab
   cd ~/network-policy-lab
   ```

2. Create a namespace for our lab

   Namespaces are used to organize our work and keep track of every kubernetes object we create.
   That's why we will create a namespace for this lab
   ```
   kubectl create namespace network-policy-lab 
   ```
   Now to check that we successfully created it, run this command
   ```
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```
   Output should be like this:
   ```
   NAME                STATUS   AGE
   default             Active   3d9h
   kube-node-lease     Active   3d9h
   kube-public         Active   3d9h
   kube-system         Active   3d9h
   network-policy-lab  Active   6s
   ```

2. Create a sample nginx pod:
   ```
   vi my-sample-pod.yml
   ```
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: network-policy-secure-pod
     namespace: network-policy-lab
     labels:
       app: secure-app
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
       ports:
       - containerPort: 80   
   ```
   ```
   kubectl apply -f my-sample-pod.yml
   ```
3. Create another pod to try connecting to the previous one:
   
   ```
   vi my-test-pod.yml
   ```
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: network-policy-client-pod
     namespace: network-policy-lab
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: busybox
       image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
       command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 3600; done"]
   
   ```
   ```
   kubectl apply -f my-test-pod.yml
   ```
4. Use this command to get the cluster IP address of the Nginx pod:
   ```
   kubectl get pod network-policy-secure-pod -n network-policy-lab -o wide
   ```
   Output should be:
   ```
   NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP          NODE           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
   network-policy-secure-pod   1/1     Running   0          4m    10.32.0.9   worker-node1   <none>           <none>
   ```
   Save the ip of the secure-pod, we will use it in the next sections. 
   
5. Use the secure pod's IP address to test network access from the client pod to the secure Nginx pod:
   
   ```
   kubectl exec network-policy-client-pod -n network-policy-lab -- curl <10.32.0.9>
   ```
   Output should be:
   ```
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
   <style>
       body {
           width: 35em;
           margin: 0 auto;
           font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
       }
   </style>
   </head>
   <body>
   <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
   <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
   working. Further configuration is required.</p>

   <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
6. Create a network policy that restricts all access to the secure pod, except to and from pods which bear the allow-access: "true" label:
   ```
   vi network-policy.yaml
   ```
   ```
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: my-network-policy
     namespace: network-policy-lab
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         app: secure-app
     policyTypes:
     - Ingress
     - Egress
     ingress:
     - from:
       - podSelector:
           matchLabels:
             allow-access: "true"
       ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
     egress:
     - to:
       - podSelector:
           matchLabels:
             allow-access: "true"
       ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80   
   ```
   ```
   kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
   ```
7. Get information about NetworkPolicies in the cluster:

   ```
   kubectl get networkpolicies -n network-policy-lab
   ```
   ```
   NAME                POD-SELECTOR     AGE
   my-network-policy   app=secure-app   2s
   ```
   ```
   kubectl describe networkpolicy my-network-policy -n network-policy-lab
   ```
   Output should be
   ```
   Name:         my-network-policy
   Namespace:    default
   Created on:   2020-10-13 22:58:08 -0400 EDT
   Labels:       <none>
   Annotations:  <none>
   Spec:
     PodSelector:     app=secure-app
     Allowing ingress traffic:
       To Port: 80/TCP
       From:
         PodSelector: allow-access=true
     Allowing egress traffic:
       To Port: 8/TCP
       To:
         PodSelector: allow-access=true
     Policy Types: Ingress, Egress
   ```
   Let's try to curl the same pod after having NetworkPolicies applied.
   ```
   kubectl exec network-policy-client-pod -n network-policy-lab -- curl <10.32.0.9>
   ```
   The command will stay on hold, trying to access the secure-pod, but nothings happens.
   ```
   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current 
   0         0      0      0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:23 --:--:--     
   ```
   Let's try to label our client-pod with "allow-access=true"
   ```
   vi my-test-pod.yml
   ```
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: network-policy-client-pod
     labels: 
       allow-access: "true"
     namespace: network-policy-lab
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: busybox
       image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
       command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 3600; done"]
   ```
   ```
   kubectl apply -f my-test-pod.yml
   ```
   Now, if we try to curl again, we will have a response back from the secure app.
   ```
   kubectl exec network-policy-client-pod -n network-policy-lab -- curl <10.32.0.9>
   ```
   Output should be:
   ```
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
   <style>
       body {
           width: 35em;
           margin: 0 auto;
           font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
       }
   </style>
   </head>
   <body>
   <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
   <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
   working. Further configuration is required.</p>
   
   <p>For online documentation and support please refer to
   <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
   Commercial support is available at
   <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>
   
   <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

8. Clean Up

   In order to keep our cluster clean and do not waste ressources, we'll delete the entire namespace that we created earlier.
   
   We can do this by using this command.
   ```
   kubectl delete namespace network-policy-lab
   ```
   Then we will delete the working space:
   ```
   sudo rm -rf ~/network-policy-lab
   ```
