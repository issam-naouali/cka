   In this exercise, you will learn how to set up a multi-node kubernetes cluster.

   - Our environment contains:
     - One master node
     - Two worker nodes
   
   - Github Repositorty: 
     - https://github.com/raed-sebti/vagrant-files 
   
   #Outcomes
   
   You should be able to setup your own multi-node Kubernetes cluster.
   
   #Steps
   
   
1. Creating the environment
         
   - Open a terminal on workstation (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run the following commands:    
   
   ```
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/raed-sebti/vagrant-files 
   mv vagrant-files kubernetes-training
   cd ~/kubernetes-training
   ```
   ```
   vagrant up
   ```   
   - Please wait for it, this might take a few minutes (about 7 min)! 
      
2. Installing Kubernetes

   - Run `vagrang ssh` command (will get you to the ansible control VM) 

   ```
   vagrant ssh
   ```    

3. Run ansible playbooks  
   
   ```
   cd src/ansible
   ansible-playbook apt.yml base.yml no-swap.yml master.yml node.yml control.yml
   ```
4. Exit from ansible control node 
   ```
   exit
   ```      
      
3. Check your kubernetes cluster

   - Now, log into your master node and run this command:

   ```
   vagrant ssh master
   ```    
   ```  
   kubectl get nodes
   ```  
   - You should see this as output:

   ```    
        NAME      STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
        master    Ready    master   3m   v1.19.3
        node1     Ready    <none>   2m   v1.19.3
        node2     Ready    <none>   2m   v1.19.3
   ```  
   - Note: If the status is not ready for one of your worker nodes, you might need to wait for a while and then try again. If nothing changed, recheck your configuration.
   - You can run this command too, to check the version of your server/client:

   ```  
      kubectl version
   ```  
   ```  
      Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"19", GitVersion:"v1.19.3", GitCommit:"f5743093fd1c663cb0cbc89748f730662345d44d", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-09-16T13:41:02Z", GoVersion:"go1.15", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
      Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"19", GitVersion:"v1.19.3", GitCommit:"f5743093fd1c663cb0cbc89748f730662345d44d", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-09-16T13:32:58Z", GoVersion:"go1.15", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
      As we can see master and worker nodes are in ready status.
      This concludes that kubernetes has been installed successfully and also we have successfully joined two worker nodes.  
   ```  
	  
	And now, you have a kubernetes cluster up and running !
