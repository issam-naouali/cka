In this exercise, you will go through some of the core concepts of the Kubernetes technology. 
#Outcomes

You should be able to:
 - Understand the relationship between docker and kubernetes
 - Organize your projects in namespaces 
 - Create deployments
 - Get infos about your k8s different objects.
 - Clean up


#Steps


4. Create a workspace for Kubernetes
   
   Open a terminal on workstation (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run the following commands:    

   Switch to root user:
   ```
   vagrant ssh master // if you are not connected to the master node
   sudo -i
   ```
   ```
   mkdir ~/concepts-lab // if not created
   cd ~/concepts-lab
   ```

5. Create a Kubernetes Namespace
   
   Namespaces are used to organize our work and keep track of every kubernetes object we create.
   That's why we will create a namespace for this lab
   ```
   kubectl create namespace concepts-lab // if not created
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   namespace/concepts-lab created
   ```
   Now to check that we successfully created it, run this command
   ```
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```

   ```
   NAME              STATUS   AGE
   concepts-lab      Active   38s
   default           Active   13d
   kube-node-lease   Active   13d
   kube-public       Active   13d
   kube-system       Active   13d
   ```
   In order to check all the kubernetes object available in our cluster, you can run:
   ```
   kubectl get all --all-namespaces
   ```
   ```
   NAMESPACE     NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   kube-system   pod/coredns-f9fd979d6-4fndq              1/1     Running   9          13d
   kube-system   pod/coredns-f9fd979d6-lctqx              1/1     Running   9          13d
   kube-system   pod/etcd-k8s-master                      1/1     Running   9          13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-apiserver-k8s-master            1/1     Running   11         13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-controller-manager-k8s-master   1/1     Running   107        13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-proxy-m2xvf                     1/1     Running   9          13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-proxy-rnrfb                     1/1     Running   8          13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-scheduler-k8s-master            1/1     Running   100        13d
   kube-system   pod/weave-net-hbpkt                      2/2     Running   25         13d
   kube-system   pod/weave-net-htmxv                      2/2     Running   22         13d
   
   NAMESPACE     NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
   default       service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP                  59s
   kube-system   service/kube-dns     ClusterIP   10.96.0.10   <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   13d
   
   NAMESPACE     NAME                        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR            AGE
   kube-system   daemonset.apps/kube-proxy   2         2         2       2            2           kube/os=linux            13d
   kube-system   daemonset.apps/weave-net    2         2         2       2            2           <none>                   13d
   
   NAMESPACE     NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   kube-system   deployment.apps/coredns   2/2     2            2           13d
   
   NAMESPACE     NAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   kube-system   replicaset.apps/coredns-f9fd979d6   2         2         2       13d
   ```

9. Create a Kubernetes deployment 

   As you can see in this figure, deployments create replicasets with the number of the pods required in them. 
   
   It offers other services that are not found in replicasets such as rolling updates and many more.

   In order to create deployments, we need to create a file written in a YAML structure.
   
   Create an empty file:
   ```
   vi deployment.yaml
   ```
   Press "i" to enter vi insert mode, then paste this:
   ```
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: hello-world-deployment
     namespace: concepts-lab
   spec:
     replicas: 4
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-deployment
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-deployment
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: hello-world-app
           image: dockertrainings2020/hello_world
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```
   Then run this command, to create whatever is inside that YAML file:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
   ```
   deployment.apps/hello-world-deployment created
   ```
   Then, let's check our deployment using the get command:
   ```
   kubectl get deployments -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   NAME                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   hello-world-deployment   4/4     4            4           23s
   ```
   And also let's check the created replicas
   ```
   kubectl get rs -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   NAME                                             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   replicaset.apps/hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f   4         4         4       83s
                                   
   ```
   Let's check the created pods
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab
   ```
   Check again our pods, you'll find that there is a new pod created instead of the deleted one:
   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-49phk   1/1     Running   0          3m17s
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-lmh5w   1/1     Running   0          3m17s
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-mszf7   1/1     Running   0          3m17s
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-n2czg   1/1     Running   0          3m17s
   ```
   ```
   kubectl get all -n concepts-lab
   ```
   Now, let's delete one of them, make sure to change the name of this pod with the one you got in your list::
   ```
   kubectl delete pods hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-49phk -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   pod "hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-49phk" deleted
   ```
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab
   ```
   As you can see, there is another pod created instead of the deleted one:
   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-hj6zm   1/1     Running   0          30s
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-lmh5w   1/1     Running   0          4m50s
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-mszf7   1/1     Running   0          4m50s
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-n2czg   1/1     Running   0          4m50s
   ```
   Therefore, you can conclude, how reliable it is to use deployments in a production environement, since it guarantees the maintance of the state that you declared at first. 
   
   There is no downtime like in the docker containers approach we did at first.

   Let's edit our deployment yaml file, and change the number of replicas to 2.
  
   ```
   vi deployment.yaml 
   ```
   Change replicas number to 2 instead of 4. 
   ```
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: hello-world-deployment
     namespace: concepts-lab
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-deployment
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-deployment
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: hello-world-app
           image: dockertrainings2020/hello_world
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```
   Then save and run this command:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
   ```
   deployment.apps/hello-world-deployment configured
   ```
   Now, if you check your Pods you'll find that we have 4 pods instead of 2 of this replicaset.
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-lmh5w   1/1     Running   0          11m
   hello-world-deployment-9f98fc45f-n2czg   1/1     Running   0          11m 
   ```
   Now, let's get pods IPs by adding -o wide option:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab -o wide
   ``` 
   Test Pods:
   ```
   curl http://POD-IP:80
   ```
   Run the describe sub command against replicaset/deployment and one of the pods to get more infos:
   ```
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n concepts-lab
   kubectl describe rs  <rs-name>  -n concepts-lab  
   kubectl describe deployment  <deployment-name>  -n concepts-lab 
   ``` 

11. Clean up (Optionally)

   Now, let's clean up all what we've created so far.
   ```
   kubectl delete namespace concepts-lab
   ```   
   ```
   namespace "concepts-lab" deleted
   ```
   Run this command in order to check everything is back to its original state:
   ````
   kubectl get all
   ```
   You need to have this as output:
   ```
   NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
   service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   4h3m
   ```
