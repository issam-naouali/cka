In this exercise, you will learn the very first basics of kubernetes.

#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Create namespaces
- Create simple pods
- Understand yaml files

#Steps


1. Create a workspace for Kubernetes
   
   Open a terminal on workstation (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run the following commands:    
   Switch to root user:
   ```
   vagrant ssh master // if you are not connected to the master node
   sudo -i
   ```
   ```
   mkdir ~/playground-lab
   cd ~/playground-lab
   ```

2. Create a Kubernetes Namespace
   
   Namespaces are used to organize our work and keep track of every kubernetes object we create.
   That's why we will create a namespace for this lab. There are two ways of creating k8s objects:
      
   - <span class="important-header">Declarative form:</span> 

      Let's start with creating an empty file:
      ```
      vi namespace.yaml
      ```
      Press "i" to enter vi insert mode, then paste this:
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Namespace
      metadata:
        name: playground-lab
      ```
      Then, run this command in order to create the namespace:
      ```
      kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
      ```
      Output:
      ```
      namespace/playground-lab created
      ```
      Now to check that we successfully created it, run this command
      ```
      kubectl get namespaces
      ```
      ```
      NAME              STATUS   AGE
      default           Active   13d
      kube-node-lease   Active   13d
      kube-public       Active   13d
      kube-system       Active   13d
      playground-lab    Active   38s
      ```
      Now, let's delete it:
      ```
      kubectl delete -f namespace.yaml
      ```
      ```
      namespace "playground-lab" deleted
      ```
   - <span class="important-header">Imperative form:</span> 

      Then you can simply run this command instead of the YAML definition:
      ```
      kubectl create namespace playground-lab
      ```
      ```
      namespace/playground-lab created
      ```
      Now to check that we successfully created it, run this command
      ```
      kubectl get namespaces
      ```
      ```
      NAME              STATUS   AGE
      default           Active   13d
      kube-node-lease   Active   13d
      kube-public       Active   13d
      kube-system       Active   13d
      playground-lab    Active   18s
      ```
3. Create your first mult-containers pod
  
   Create an empty file:
   ```
   vi multi-containers-pod.yaml
   ```
   Press "i" to enter vi insert mode, then paste this:
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: multi-containers-pod
     namespace: playground-lab
     labels:
       app: first-app
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: first-container-nginx
       image: nginx
     - name: second-container-busybox
       image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
       command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do curl localhost ; sleep 60; done;']         
   ```
   Now, run this command, we'll explain in a bit every thing in this YAMl file.
   ```
   kubectl create -f multi-containers-pod.yaml
   ```
   ```
   pod/multi-containers-pod created
   ```
   Now, let's check that our pod is running:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n playground-lab
   ```
   Output should be:
   ```
   NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   multi-containers-pod   2/2     Running   0          8s
   ```
   See the logs:
   - Use `-c` option to specify the conatiner name  
   - Optionally: add -f option for real time follow mode

   ```
   kubectl logs multi-containers-pod -c second-container-busybox -n playground-lab -f
   ```
   Output should be:
   ```
   Welcome to nginx
   ```
   We can have more details about this pod using the command:
   ```
   kubectl describe pod multi-containers-pod -n playground-lab
   ```
   Output should be:
   ```
    Name:         multi-containers-pod
    Namespace:    playground-lab

   ```
   In the events section, you can check why is your pod at its current state and what happened since it was created.

4. Understanding Yaml files
   
   YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

   Which means YAML files are not only used in kubernetes, but we can find them elsewhere and it's an important skill to learn how to deal with them.

   Here some rules that you should respect while typing YAML:
   - <b>YAML is case sensitive.</b>
   - <b>The files should have .yaml as the extension.</b>
   - <b>YAML does not allow the use of tabs while creating YAML files; spaces are allowed instead.</b>
   - <b>Children of the same parent, must be indented with the same number of spaces (usually 2 spaces).</b>

   Now, let's take a closer look on the previous yaml file:
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: first-pod
     labels:
       app: first-app
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: myapp-container
       image: busybox
       command: ['echo']
       args: ['Hello World!']
   ```
   Here is the explanation of every term in the yaml file:

   - <span class="important-note">apiVersion:</span> Kubernetes API version, which indicates the path to ensure the API presents a clear, consistent view of system resources and behaviour.
   - <span class="important-note">kind:</span> Represents the kind of object you want to create. This is a required field. Examples are: pod, deployment, replicaset ..
   - <span class="important-note">metadata:</span> Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name, UID, and optional namespace and labels.
   - <span class="important-note">spec:</span> Describes your desired state for the object and the characteristics you want the object to have. The format of the object spec is different for every object.
   - <span class="important-note">containers:</span> This is a list of all the containers that you want to have on your pod. 
5. Clean up (Optionally)

   Now, let's delete everyting we created. We can simply delete the namespace itslef, this will delete all the objects created in this namespace.
   ```
   kubectl delete namespace playground-lab
   ```
   ```
   namespace "playground-lab" deleted
   ```
   Now, let's check the namespaces lists:
   ```
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   NAME              STATUS   AGE
   default           Active   13d
   kube-node-lease   Active   13d
   kube-public       Active   13d
   kube-system       Active   13d
   ```
