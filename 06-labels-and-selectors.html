In this exercise, you will learn how to use labels and selectors in your kubernetes objects.

#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Assign labels to your pods
- Set the right selectors
- Clean up.

#Steps

1. Create a workspace for Kubernetes
   
   Open a terminal on workstation (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run the following commands:    

   Switch to root user:
   ```
   vagrant ssh master // if you are not connected to the master node
   sudo -i
   ```
   ```
   mkdir ~/labels-lab
   cd ~/labels-lab
   ```

2. Create a namespace for our lab

   Namespaces are used to organize our work and keep track of every kubernetes object we create.
   That's why we will create a namespace for this lab
   ```
   kubectl create namespace labels-lab
   ```
   Now to check that we successfully created it, run this command
   ```
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```
   Output should be like this:
   ```
   NAME              STATUS   AGE
   default           Active   3d9h
   kube-node-lease   Active   3d9h
   kube-public       Active   3d9h
   kube-system       Active   3d9h
   labels-lab        Active   6s
   ```

2. Creating a labeled deployment 

  Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users, but do not directly imply semantics to the core system.

  Let's see them in action. create an empty file:
  ```
  vi labels-deploy.yaml
  ```
  Press "i" to enter vi insert mode, then paste this:
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: labels-deployment
    namespace: labels-lab
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: frontend
        version: "1"
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: frontend
          version: "1"
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: frontend-container
          image: dockertrainings2020/hello_world
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  ```
  Now, we just need to create it using
  ```
  kubectl apply -f labels-deploy.yaml
  ```
  ```
  deployment.apps/labels-deployment created
  ```
  In order to check our created deployment, run:
  ```
  kubectl get deployments -n labels-lab
  ```
  Output should be:
  ```
  NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  labels-deployment   2/2     2            2           103s
  ```
  Or you can check the pods in it:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n labels-lab
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-jftbz   1/1     Running   0          14s
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-tdv8k   1/1     Running   0          14s
  ```
  Now, let's create a different deployment as a version 2 of this app:
  ```
  vi labels-deploy-v2.yaml
  ```
  Press "i" to enter vi insert mode, then paste this:
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: labels-deployment-v2
    namespace: labels-lab
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: frontend
        version: "2"
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: frontend
          version: "2"
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: frontend-container
          image: dockertrainings2020/hello_world
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  ```
  Now, we just need to create it using
  ```
  kubectl apply -f labels-deploy-v2.yaml
  ```
  ```
  deployment.apps/labels-deployment-v2 created
  ```
  In order to check our created deployment, run:
  ```
  kubectl get deployments -n labels-lab
  ```
  Output should be:
  ```
  NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  labels-deployment      2/2     2            2           12m
  labels-deployment-v2   2/2     2            2           4m13s
  ```
  Or you can check the pods in it:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n labels-lab
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-jftbz     1/1     Running   0          12m
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-tdv8k     1/1     Running   0          12m
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-m76bc   1/1     Running   0          3m45s
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-xdtnl   1/1     Running   0          3m45s
  ```

  Now, let's add the labels to this output:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n labels-lab -L app,version
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     APP        VERSION
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-jftbz     1/1     Running   0          13m     frontend   1
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-tdv8k     1/1     Running   0          13m     frontend   1
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-m76bc   1/1     Running   0          5m21s   frontend   2
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-xdtnl   1/1     Running   0          5m21s   frontend   2
  ```
  If we want to display only the version 1 pods, we can run:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n labels-lab -L app,version --selector "version=1"
  ```
  ```
  NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   APP        VERSION
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-jftbz   1/1     Running   0          14m   frontend   1
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-tdv8k   1/1     Running   0          14m   frontend   1
  ```

  Let's now create the last deployment:
  ```
  vi labels-deploy-v3.yaml
  ```
  Press "i" to enter vi insert mode, then paste this:
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: labels-deployment-v3
    namespace: labels-lab
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: backend
        version: "3"
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: backend
          version: "3"
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: frontend-container
          image: dockertrainings2020/hello_world
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  ```
  Now, we just need to create it using
  ```
  kubectl apply -f labels-deploy-v3.yaml
  ```
  ```
  deployment.apps/labels-deployment-v3 created
  ```
  In order to check our created deployment, run:
  ```
  kubectl get deployments -n labels-lab
  ```
  Output should be:
  ```
  NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  labels-deployment      2/2     2            2           16m
  labels-deployment-v2   2/2     2            2           8m1s
  labels-deployment-v3   2/2     2            2           13s
  ```
  Or you can check the pods in it:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n labels-lab -L app,version
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     APP        VERSION
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-jftbz      1/1     Running   0          16m     frontend   1
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-tdv8k      1/1     Running   0          16m     frontend   1
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-m76bc    1/1     Running   0          8m18s   frontend   2
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-xdtnl    1/1     Running   0          8m18s   frontend   2
  labels-deployment-v3-758c7cb895-cc7xn   1/1     Running   0          30s     backend    3
  labels-deployment-v3-758c7cb895-rp5hs   1/1     Running   0          30s     backend    3
  ```
  If we want to select the pods that are not a "backend" pod, we can run:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n labels-lab -L app,version --selector "app!=backend"
  ```
  ```
  NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   APP        VERSION
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-jftbz     1/1     Running   0          21m   frontend   1
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-tdv8k     1/1     Running   0          21m   frontend   1
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-m76bc   1/1     Running   0          12m   frontend   2
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-xdtnl   1/1     Running   0          12m   frontend   2
  ```
  We can select the pods that have a version 1 and 3:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n labels-lab -L app,version --selector "version in (1,3)"
  ```
  ```
  NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   APP        VERSION
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-jftbz     1/1     Running   0          29m   frontend   1
  labels-deployment-7877587d8f-tdv8k     1/1     Running   0          29m   frontend   1
  labels-deployment-v3-98f66487f-82hd8   1/1     Running   0          11m   backend    3
  labels-deployment-v3-98f66487f-rcvdk   1/1     Running   0          11m   backend    3
  ```
  Finally, we will select the pods that have a version-2 and app=frontend:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n labels-lab -L app,version --selector "version=2,app=frontend"
  ```
  ```
  NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   APP        VERSION
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-m76bc   1/1     Running   0          22m   frontend   2
  labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-xdtnl   1/1     Running   0          22m   frontend   2
  ```
  There are also other selectors like:
    - notin (identifier1, identifier2)
    - exists(key identifier)
  
5. Clean up

  In order to keep our cluster clean and do not waste ressources, we'll delete every k8s object created in this lab.
  We can do this by using this command.

   ```
   kubectl delete all --all -n labels-lab
   ```
   ```
   pod "labels-deployment-7877587d8f-jftbz" deleted
   pod "labels-deployment-7877587d8f-tdv8k" deleted
   pod "labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-m76bc" deleted
   pod "labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd-xdtnl" deleted
   pod "labels-deployment-v3-98f66487f-82hd8" deleted
   pod "labels-deployment-v3-98f66487f-rcvdk" deleted
   deployment.apps "labels-deployment" deleted
   deployment.apps "labels-deployment-v2" deleted
   deployment.apps "labels-deployment-v3" deleted
   replicaset.apps "labels-deployment-7877587d8f" deleted
   replicaset.apps "labels-deployment-v2-ddb7d54dd" deleted
   replicaset.apps "labels-deployment-v3-98f66487f" deleted
   ```
   Then delete the namespace
   ```
   kubectl delete namespace labels-lab
   ```
   Finally, delete the working directory:
   ```
   sudo rm -rf ~/labels-lab
   ```
