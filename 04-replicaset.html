In this exercise, you will go through some of the core concepts of the Kubernetes technology. 
#Outcomes

You should be able to:
 - Organize your projects in namespaces 
 - Create replicasets
 - Get infos about your k8s different objects.
 - Clean up

#Steps


4. Create a workspace for Kubernetes
   
   Open a terminal on workstation (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run the following commands:    

   Switch to root user:
   ```
   vagrant ssh master // if you are not connected to the master node
   sudo -i
   ```
   ```
   mkdir ~/concepts-lab
   cd ~/concepts-lab
   ```

5. Create a Kubernetes Namespace
   
   Namespaces are used to organize our work and keep track of every kubernetes object we create.
   That's why we will create a namespace for this lab
   ```
   kubectl create namespace concepts-lab
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   namespace/concepts-lab created
   ```
   Now to check that we successfully created it, run this command
   ```
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```

   ```
   NAME              STATUS   AGE
   concepts-lab      Active   38s
   default           Active   13d
   kube-node-lease   Active   13d
   kube-public       Active   13d
   kube-system       Active   13d
   ```
   In order to check all the kubernetes object available in our cluster, you can run:
   ```
   kubectl get all --all-namespaces
   ```
   ```
   NAMESPACE     NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   kube-system   pod/coredns-f9fd979d6-4fndq              1/1     Running   9          13d
   kube-system   pod/coredns-f9fd979d6-lctqx              1/1     Running   9          13d
   kube-system   pod/etcd-k8s-master                      1/1     Running   9          13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-apiserver-k8s-master            1/1     Running   11         13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-controller-manager-k8s-master   1/1     Running   107        13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-proxy-m2xvf                     1/1     Running   9          13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-proxy-rnrfb                     1/1     Running   8          13d
   kube-system   pod/kube-scheduler-k8s-master            1/1     Running   100        13d
   kube-system   pod/weave-net-hbpkt                      2/2     Running   25         13d
   kube-system   pod/weave-net-htmxv                      2/2     Running   22         13d
   
   NAMESPACE     NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
   default       service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP                  59s
   kube-system   service/kube-dns     ClusterIP   10.96.0.10   <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   13d
   
   NAMESPACE     NAME                        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR            AGE
   kube-system   daemonset.apps/kube-proxy   2         2         2       2            2           kube/os=linux            13d
   kube-system   daemonset.apps/weave-net    2         2         2       2            2           <none>                   13d
   
   NAMESPACE     NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   kube-system   deployment.apps/coredns   2/2     2            2           13d
   
   NAMESPACE     NAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   kube-system   replicaset.apps/coredns-f9fd979d6   2         2         2       13d
   ```

8. Create a Kubernetes ReplicaSet

   A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. 
   
   As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods. 
   <img src="images/mod8/two.png" width="600" height="600" style="margin: 20px auto;" />

   Create an empty file:
   ```
   vi replicaset.yaml
   ```
   Press "i" to enter vi insert mode, then paste this:
   ```
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: ReplicaSet
   metadata:
     name: hello-world-replicaset
     namespace: concepts-lab
     labels:
       app: hello-world 
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: hello-world 
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: hello-world
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: hello-world-container 
           image: dockertrainings2020/hello_world
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
   ```
   ```
   kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
   ```
   ```
   replicaset.apps/hello-world-replicaset created
   ```
   Now, run this command to check the results:
   ```
   kubectl get replicaset -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   hello-world-replicaset   2         2         1       15s
   ```
   We can check the pods created by this replicaset as well:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   hello-world-replicaset-5274c   1/1     Running   0          2m32s
   hello-world-replicaset-9h9c2   1/1     Running   0          2m32s
   ```
   Or, we could use a single command to replace the previous two commands:
   ```
   kubectl get po,rs -n concepts-lab
   or
   kubectl get all -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   pod/hello-world-replicaset-5274c   1/1     Running   0          83s
   pod/hello-world-replicaset-9h9c2   1/1     Running   0          83s
   
   NAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   replicaset.apps/hello-world-replicaset   2         2         2       83s
   ```
   Let's try deleting one pod from this replicaset, make sure to change the name of this pod with the one you got in your list:
   ```
   kubectl delete pod hello-world-replicaset-5274c -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   pod "hello-world-replicaset-5274c" deleted
   ```
   Now, check your pods again
   
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab
   ```

   ```
   NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   hello-world-replicaset-plswv   1/1     Running   0          11s
   hello-world-replicaset-9h9c2   1/1     Running   0          10m
   ```
   As you can see, there is a new pod that was automatically created instead of the deleted one.

   Let's edit our replicaset yaml file, and change the number of replicas to 4.
  
   ```
   vi replicaset.yaml 
   ```
   Change replicas number to 4 instead of 2. 
   ```
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: ReplicaSet
   metadata:
     name: hello-world-replicaset
     namespace: concepts-lab
     labels:
       app: hello-world 
   spec:
     replicas: 4
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: hello-world 
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: hello-world
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: hello-world-container 
           image: dockertrainings2020/hello_world
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
   ```
   Then save and run this command:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
   ```
   ```
   replicaset.apps/hello-world-replicaset configured
   ```
   Now, if you check your Pods you'll find that we have 4 pods instead of 2 of this replicaset.
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab
   ``` 
   ```
   NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   hello-world-replicaset-9khx2   1/1     Running   0          93s
   hello-world-replicaset-cmnzl   1/1     Running   0          93s
   hello-world-replicaset-plswv   1/1     Running   0           5m
   hello-world-replicaset-9h9c2   1/1     Running   0          15m
   ```
   Now, let's get pods IPs by adding -o wide option:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab -o wide
   ``` 
   Test Pods:
   ```
   curl http://POD-IP:8080
   ```
   Run the describe sub command against replicaset and one of the pods to get more infos:
   ```
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n concepts-lab
   kubectl describe rs  <rs-name>  -n concepts-lab  
   ``` 
   Now, let's clean up all what we've created so far.
   ```
   kubectl delete replicaset hello-world-replicaset -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   replicaset.apps "hello-world-replicaset" deleted
   ```
   Now, if you check the pods list, you'll find it empty, since deleting the replicaset will also delete all the pods in it.
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n concepts-lab
   ```
   ```
   No resources found in concepts-lab namespace.
   ```

11. Clean up (Optionally)

   Now, let's clean up all what we've created so far.
   ```
   kubectl delete namespace concepts-lab
   ```   
   ```
   namespace "concepts-lab" deleted
   ```
   Run this command in order to check everything is back to its original state:
   ````
   kubectl get all
   ```
   You need to have this as output:
   ```
   NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
   service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   4h3m
   ```
